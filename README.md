# Tic_Tac_Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows two players to play the game in a web browser.

How to Play:-
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on a cell to place your mark (either X or O).
The game alternates between X and O with each click.
The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

File Structure:-
index.html: The main HTML file for the game
style.css: The CSS file for styling the game board
app.js: The JavaScript file for game logic
